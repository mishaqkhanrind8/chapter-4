    JavaScript Local Storage
</h1>

<h2>local storage</h2>

<p><code>local storage</code> is a way to <code>store data</code> on the user's browser.</p>
<p>it's like a small database that lives inside your web browser. This storage persists even after you close the browser.</p>
<p>local storage is a <code>window object property</code>, which makes it a global object that can interact with and 
    manipulate the browser window.</p>

<h2>window.localStorage</h2>

<p>The localStorage mechanism is available via the <code>window.localStorage</code> property.</p>
<p><code>Window.localStorage</code> is part of the window interface in JavaScript, which represents a window containing
     a DDM document.</p>
<p>THe window interface features a wide rang of functions, constructors, objects, and namespaces.</p>
<p><code>WIndow.localStorage</code> is a read-only property that returns a refernce to the local storange abject used to 
    store data that is only accessible to the origin that created it.</p>

    <h2>when to use localStorage?</h2>

<p>Put simply, <code>localStorage</code> is used for <code>storing</code> and <code>retrieving data</code>, While you can
     store small amounts of data with <code>localStorage</code>, it's not suitable for large datasets.</p>
<p><code>localStorage</code> is accessible to anyone who uses the device, so you shouldn't use it to store sensitive information.</p>
<p>You can use it to store user preferences, like language or theme.</p>
<p>You can also use it to cache data if you use it frequently.</p>
<p><code>localStorage</code> can store form data that won't be lost if the user closes the browser.</p>
<p>if you have an application that requires you to log in, <code>localStorage</code> can be used to keep your session data.</p>
<p>You can remain logged in even after closing and reopening the browser.</p>

<h2>where is localStorage stored?</h2>

<p><code>LocalStorage</code> is stored within the browser itself.</p>
<p>Each browser (e.g., Chrome, firefox, Safari) has its own implementation and storage location for this data.</p>
<p>On a lower level, <code>localStorage</code> is seved to the file system of your device.</p>
<p>For instance, in Chrome, it's stored in the user's profile directory under a specific file path, which varies
     depending on the operating system.</p>
<p><code>WIndows:</code> C:\User\&lt;YourUsername&gt;\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Local Storage</p>
<p><code>macOS:</code> -/Library/application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Local Storage</p>
<p><code>Linux:</code> -/config/google-chrome/Default/Local Storage</p>

<h2>key features</h2>

<p>Data stored in local storage presists even after the broser is closed or the computer is restored.</p>
<p>Each webiste can store up to <code>5MB of data</code> in local storage. which is sually enough for stroing user preferences.
     settings, or small omounts of data.</p>
<p>Local storage can only store <code>strings</code>.</p>
<p>This means if you need to store values like objects or arrays, you first need to get a string representation of the value.
You do this using the <code>JSON.stringify()</code> method.</p>
